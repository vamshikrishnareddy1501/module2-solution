    <h1>Best Smartphones of 2020</h1>

                <h2>Galaxy S20</h2>
                <p>
                    The best smartphone around? Certainly for Android fans.
                    If you're after a bigger phone with all the features that matter on board, the Galaxy S20/S20 Plus is that and more.
                    Colours can look a tad washed out when the exposure is higher, but the power of the sensor, with memory built into it to make it smarter than most rivals, offers very low-noise shots.

                <h2>OnePlus 7T Pro</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the highest-spec phones on the market
                    It's hard to wrap the OnePlus 7T Pro into a mini verdict - it does so much and we've not even touched on the new, camera-remote-enabled Bluetooth. The expansive, quality screen, the battery life and the camera all combine to make this a stunning smartphone... if you can afford it.

                <h2>iPhone 11 Pro</h2>
                <p>
                    The best iPhone Apple has ever made
                    This is the phone to buy if you want to treat yourself to a high-end handset â€“ a little extra per month for something you really enjoy taking out of your bag or pocket is worth it. iPhone 11 also has Apple's new A13 Bionic processor, which is both more powerful and efficient than the A12 Bionic in the iPhone XR. It's plenty fast.
